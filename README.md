ATM Simulation System (Console Application)
📌 Project Description

The ATM Simulation System is a Java-based console application that simulates basic ATM functionalities.
It allows users to perform card-based and card-less transactions, PIN generation, balance enquiry, deposit, and withdrawal operations using a menu-driven interface.

This project focuses on core Java concepts, OOP design, and multithreading, making it suitable for fresher-level learning and practice.

🛠 Technologies Used

Java

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Multithreading (Runnable, Thread)

Java Collections

Input Validation

✨ Features

Card-based transactions (Balance Enquiry, Withdrawal)

Card-less transactions (Deposit, Withdrawal)

PIN generation and verification with OTP logic

Menu-driven console interface

Multithreaded loading simulation for real-time processing feel

Proper validation for PINs, account numbers, and inputs

📂 Project Structure

ProjectATM – Main class to start the application

CardTransaction – Handles card-based operations

CardLess – Handles card-less transactions

PinGeneration – Manages OTP and PIN setup
